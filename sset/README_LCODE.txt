README FOR LCODE.H

written by jig 11/11/2016

Note that there were some un-resolvable conflicts in lcode.h across rigs. For now I "solved" it by updating everything to the rig2 conventions. However, this means that spm files may be out of date.

For rig 1, check in lcode.h for "Added by jig 11/11/16 from rig1" to possibly revert back
